```{r, silent=TRUE}
library(phenocamapi)
library(plotly)
library(phenocamr)
library(dplyr)
```

Let's start by pulling in a list of PhenoCam sites:

```{r}
phenos=get_phenos()
#and let's check the column names:
colnames(phenos)

```

Now let's filter for NEON sites:
```{r}
NEONphenos=phenos%>%
  filter(group==c('NEON', 'NEON AMERIFLUX'))
head(NEONphenos)
```

Filter for the 3 sites that you guys mentioned:
```{r}
NEONphenos=NEONphenos[c(2, 10, 36), ]
```
